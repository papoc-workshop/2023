The 10th Workshop on Principles and Practice of Consistency for Distributed Data (PaPoC '23) took place on May 8th, 2023.
Like the previous years, the PaPoC workshop was held in conjunction with EuroSys 2023.
A total of 14 papers where presented, 12 of them are in the proceedings.
These papers were selected among 20 papers which were initially submitted to the workshop.

This year edition was the 10th occurrent of the PaPoC workshop series.
To celebrate this event, the organizers in agreement with the Steering Committee decided to give a Test-Of-Time award to an influencial paper that was published over the past 10 years at the workshop.
A test-of-time award committee was formed for this occasion.
The \href{http://www.bailis.org/blog/bridging-the-gap-opportunities-in-coordination-avoiding-databases/}{paper} they selected is:

\begin{RCText}[.5cm]
  \textit{Bridging the Gap: Opportunities in Coordination-Avoiding Database Systems} \\
  by Peter Bailis, Alan Fekete, Ali Ghodsi, Mike Franklin, Joe Hellerstein, and Ion Stoica.
\end{RCText}

It was presented at PaPoC 2014, held in conjunction with the Eurosys '14 conference, in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
This work was influential in challenging the common idea of using strong consistency levels as a one-size-fits-all solution.
In this paper, the authors look at popular benchmarks and applications and investigate where coordination is actually needed, and where it can be avoided.
An extended version of this paper was later presented at SIGMOD in 2014.
